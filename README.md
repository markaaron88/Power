# Power
Write a C++ program called power.cpp to compute 2n for a nonnegative integer n. In this
program, you have to develop a recursive function to calculate it. And also, you canâ€™t use a library
in the program.
For the problem, you can assume that the user always enter a correct integer number which is greater
than or equal to zero.
